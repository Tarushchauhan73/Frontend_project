The frontend of the system serves as the user–facing interface through which files are uploaded to the backend for encryption, chunking, and storage, and through which the user can later download stored files. The frontend is intentionally designed to be minimal, lightweight, and browser-friendly, ensuring ease of demonstration while still fulfilling the requirements of functionality, clarity, and usability.
The entire frontend is developed using standard web technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. No heavy external UI framework (like React, Angular, or Bootstrap) was used, because the aim of this project phase is to present a clean proof-of-concept interface that directly interacts with the Flask backend through REST API calls. By doing so, the focus remains on the core security and cloud storage logic rather than UI complexity.
The user interface contains two primary functional sections:
File Upload Section
This section allows users to browse and select any file from their local device. When the user clicks the "Upload" button, JavaScript collects the file object and sends it to the Flask backend’s /upload API endpoint using the Fetch API and FormData. The entire file upload workflow happens asynchronously, without page reloads. Once the backend completes AES encryption and chunk distribution, the frontend displays a success confirmation.
File Listing and Download Section
Below the upload interface, the frontend displays a dynamic table of all previously uploaded files. This list is loaded automatically by calling the /files endpoint when the webpage loads. Each file entry includes its filename and a “Download” button. When clicked, the browser opens /download/<file_id> which triggers the backend to fetch chunk metadata, reconstruct the file, decrypt it, and stream it back to the user as the original file.
The frontend layout also incorporates light CSS styling for a cleaner professional appearance that is suitable for academic demonstration and project viva panels. Buttons, input fields, and tables are styled to make the interface intuitive, readable, and user friendly.
Overall, this frontend acts as a practical, simple demonstration layer that bridges the user with the secure backend logic. In future enhancements, this can be evolved into a full-scale production-grade interface using frameworks like React or Next.js, but for the scope of this project, this lightweight frontend is appropriate, maintainable, and aligns with the goal of showcasing secure cloud storage through encryption and chunk distribution.
